Tech used:- Nodejs, express, Mysql and Sequelize ORM.

I've used my own template as i was having issue with the template due to es syntax.
It was using the old require versioning.

I tried changin them but there wese many issues.

I've used postman for docs:

I've used model, controller and routes structuring.
I'll include the sql file and postman collection in repo itself.
